# Install

The recommended way to get BrazilCEP is to **install the latest stable release**
via [pip](http://pip-installer.org>):

```sh
$ pip install brazilcep
```

We currently support **Python 3.8+ only**. Users on older interpreter versions
are urged to upgrade.

BrazilCEP has only a few **direct dependencies**:

- [Zeep](https://pypi.org/project/zeep): for SOAP requests.
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests): for REST API requests.
